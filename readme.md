# Data Modeling Assignment

## Pre-Requisites

- [ ] Please read and follow along with the [Data Modeling](data-modeling.md) file

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Be able to model relational data in SQL (Without actually writing any SQL)
- [ ] Model a many to many relationship
- [ ] Demonstrate an understanding of how user interactions populate our database

## Introduction

Here's an app that Instructor Jon built called GloomTyper. It's just a simple typing test game. Take a moment to explore the page and play with the application.

Your job is to model the data that makes this app run. Keep in mind, the typing, timer, and other minor browser details are not going to be stored in the database. However, the Categories, Authors, and Quotes on the top right will be!

Your task is to model the database data in an SQL diagram. Be sure to mark separate tables clearly, show which values live in which tables, and indicate the relationships between tables (1-1, 1-Many, Many-Many.)

## To Submit

Please submit the following deliverables:

- [ ] A diagram of the data model you came up with
  - [ ] Make sure that you use the proper drawing style (Crows Feet to represent many) in order to represent your data
  - [ ] Make sure to include the column names on the tables that you are drawing
  - Use whatever digital tool you'd like to create it, I really like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and VSCode [has a plugin for it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) so you don't even have to leave your editor
  - If you're looking for an example of a diagram, you can look at the [Example Diagram](example-data-model.excalidraw) file. This is just an example and if you copy it exactly you will definitely not get the correct answer.
- [ ] Tables that are filled out with the rows and columns that you think are in the database
  - These tables do not have be in markdown, but can be
  - [ ] Please remember if you use something like google sheets to make public access visible
- [ ] Make sure that the column names / table names match between the diagram and the tables document that you are providing
