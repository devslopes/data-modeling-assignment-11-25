# Data Modeling Assignment

## Pre-Requisites

- [ ] Please read and follow along with the [Data Modeling](data-modeling.md) file

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Be able to model relational data in SQL (Without actually writing any SQL)
- [ ] Model a many to many relationship
- [ ] Demonstrate an understanding of how user interactions populate our database

## Introduction

Here's an app that Instructor Jon built called [GloomTyper](gloomtyper-2-0.vercel.app). It's just a simple typing test game. Your job is to do your best to model the data for this application (We're not going to tell you what the data is, you have to guess based off how the app works).

So please, click around the app, take a few typing tests, and then come up with your best guess at how the data is modeled in the application.

## To Submit

Please submit the following deliverables:

- [ ] A diagram of the data model you came up with
  - Use whatever digital tool you'd like to create it, I really like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and VSCode [has a plugin for it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) so you don't even have to leave your editor
  - If you're looking for an example of a diagram, you can look at the [Example Diagram](example-data-model.excalidraw) file. This is just an example and if you copy it exactly you will definitely not get the correct answer.
- [ ] Tables that are filled out with the rows and columns that you think are in the database
  - These tables do not have be in markdown, but can be
  - [ ] Please remember if you use something like google sheets to make public access visible
